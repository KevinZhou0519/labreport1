1. cd with nothing: it is home when I run cd. If we do not add anything to the cd at the beginning, then nothing will happen because it is changing the dictionary back to home. However, if we are in a different dictionary, then cd with nothing will change the path back to home.There is no error
2. cd with folder: the path is home when I run cd. This will change the path to a folder(cd filename) therefore we can run or read another file, folder from the folder you just cd to. There is no error
3. cd with file: the path is lab-folder when I run cd. It has an error because we can only cd to a dictionary/folder. If we change it to a file, you cannot access more things from the file, then there is no point of using cd.
4. ls with nothing: the path is lab-folder when I run ls. With nothing, the ls will print out what are in this current folder in default. It print out the lab file1 and file2 and another folder people. There is no error
5. ls with folder:the path is lab-folder when I run ls. With another folder, it will just print out what is inside the folder after ls. In this case, I add people after ls and it will print out kevin and jason.txt. There is no error
6. ls with file:the path is lab-folder when I run ls.With file, it will just print out the file I inputed in because there is no more file or folder inside the file. I inputed the lab-file1.txt and it print out the lab-file1.txt. There is no error
7. cat with nothing: the path is lab-folder when I run cat. With nothing, it will repeat whatever I typed because cat is print the contents of files given by the path. Since there are nothing, it will just repeat what I typed for input. There is no error.
8. cat with folder:the path is lab-folder when I run cat. With the folder as the path input, an error will occur. Because nothing got print out if it is a dictionary/folder
9. cat with file:the path is lab-folder when I run cat. With a file, it will print out the content inside a file path. In this case, it printed what is in the lab-file1.txt, which is "Hello, there is a cat eating food". There is no error
