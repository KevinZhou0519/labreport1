1. cd with nothing: it is home when I run cd. If we do not add anything to the cd at the beginning, then nothing will happen because it is changing the dictionary back to home. However, if we are in a different dictionary, then cd with nothing will change the path back to home.There is no error
2. cd with folder: it is home when I run cd. This will change the path to a folder(cd filename) therefore we can run or read another file, folder from the folder you just cd to. There is no error
3. cd with file: it is lab-folder when I run cd. It has an error because we can only cd to a dictionary/folder. If we change it to a file, you cannot access more things from the file, then there is no point of using cd.
4. ls with nothing: it is lab-folder when I run ls. With nothing, the ls will print out what are in this current folder in default. 
5. ls with folder:it is lab-folder when I run ls.
6. ls with file:it is lab-folder when I run ls.
7. cat with nothing: it is lab-folder when I run cat.
8. cat with folder:it is lab-folder when I run cat.
9. cat with file:it is lab-folder when I run cat.
